## libstempo — a Python wrapper for tempo2 ##

Please see http://vallis.github.io/libstempo.

Note that the master branch has now been switched to version 2.X of libstempo, which has a new (and better!) API. Look at the [demo notebook](https://github.com/vallis/libstempo/blob/master/demo/libstempo-demo.ipynb) for a description. The old API is still available in the libstempo1 branch.
